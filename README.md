## Setting the Stage
Prepare for the hands-on content with our PowerPoint presentation that outlines session objectives, setup instructions, and key technical insights. This deck will help you get familiar with the workshop agenda and the tools you’ll be using.

## Microhack Challenges

Attendees will tackle a series of technical challenges that require the use of Microsoft Azure, Copilot Studio, and other Microsoft technologies to build secure, scalable, and data-driven solutions. Each challenge is designed to reinforce foundational skills in cloud computing, real-time analytics, and collaborative problem-solving.
